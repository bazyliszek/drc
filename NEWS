## Changes in 'drc'

2009-09-03: The function comped() has been removed. 

2009-09-02: The argument "extended" has been added to the function maED().

2009-09-01: The twophase() model function based on log-logistic models has been added (after an idea by Ida Katarina Auf der Maur Hindrichsen).

2009-07-28: Small bug in cedergreen() and ucedergreen() related to calculation of ED values has been fixed (reported by Clare Della Vedova).

2009-07-27: Small bug in the function modelFit() has been fixed (after feedback from Heike Schmitt).

2009-07-27: Help page for CRS.5a has been improved (after comment from Claire Della Vedova).

2009-07-06: The functions lin.test(), mr.test(), and neill.test() have been added.

2009-06-30: The data frame etmotc has been included.

2009-06-08: The argument 'display' (with same functionality as in Ed()) has been added for compParm() (after a suggestion from Scott Ray).

2009-06-02: The help pages for anova.drc and BC.4(), BC.5(), CRS.5.() have been improved.

2009-05-29: The dataset ecvam has been included (migrated from the package 'mrdrc').

2009-05-28: The function maED() for parametric model averaging has been added.

2009-05-27: The functions fplogistic() and FPL.4() enable fitting dose-response models based on fractional polynomials. The function maED() can be used to do model-average based estimation of ED values.

2009-05-24: Structure of self starter functions has been completely revamped. Four initial value procedure are now available for almost all implemented dose-response models.

2009-05-23: The function getInitial() has been included.

2009-05-20: Help page for ED() has been improved (after comment from Claire Della Vedova).

2009-05-07: Bug in ED() concerning the arguments type="absolute" and reference="upper" has been resolved (reported by Yue Zeng-Li).

2009-04-22: Help page for gompertz() has been improved slightly.

2009-04-08: Help page for earthworms dataset has been improved. Error in likelihood calculation for some binomial models has been fixed.

2009-04-07: mixture() also works for binomial data. Argument "legendCex" in the plot 
method renamed into "cex.legend" in line with other cex arguments.

2009-04-01: Minor internals changes in drm() and in the plot method.

2009-03-27: The convenience functions b.3(), B.3(), b.4(), B.4(), b.5(), B.5(), and boltzmann have been removed. Use L.3(), L.4(), and L.5() instead. compParm(), ED(), SI() have been  restructured. drm() has been extended to allow fitting models separately for each curve. confint, summary, vcov, ED, MAX, SI have a new argument "pool" to allow pooling of separate fits. Argument "ci" in relpot() and SI() has been renamed into "interval". modelFit() now also works for binomial data.

2009-03-25: The dataset "algae" has been included. vcov method has been re-structured.

2009-03-24: The function plotraw() has been removed. Initial plots of the data should be done using R's standard plotting functionality, e.g. plot and xyplot(). 

2009-03-19: The argument "conLevel" has a more sensible default (no longer hardcorded at 0.01). The argument "xsty" has been introduced to control the arrangement of tick marks on the dose axis. 

2009-03-17: The function yieldLoss() has been included to handle a different parameterization of the Michaelis-Menten model (after a suggestion by Andrew Kniss).

2009-03-11: The argument "fctList" has been removed from drm().

2009-03-06: mixture() has been completely revised with a lot of changes to the arguments. 
The model function richards() has been removed as it is simply a different parameterization of the five-parameter log-logistic model. colFct() has also been removed.

2009-03-04: A new function modelFit() has been introduced for assessing the model fit, partly replacing the anova method.

2009-02-27: Bug in mselect() has been fixed (reported by John Lewis).

2009-02-25: Bug in boxcox.drc has been fixed. Moreover, this method has been extended to include functionality previously available through drm().

2009-02-19: multdrc() and associated mdControl have been taken completely out of use. drm() has been improved w.r.t. handling extremely small or large dose or response values. Arguments "lowerc" and "upperc" have been removed in model functions as they were redundant.

2009-02-13: Argument "ci" renames into "interval" in ED().

2009-02-12: Bug in predict.drc fixed (thanks to Mario D'Antuono).

2009-02-09: Redundant encoding removed. Argument "fixed" added to BC.4() and BC.5() (thanks to Nina Cedergreen).

2008-12-02: Dataset "H.virescens" added. Asymptotic regression and exponential
decay implemented differently.

2008-11-26: "lnormal" function has been added plus three new datasets.

2008-11-18: "gompertz" function has been added.

2008-11-13: Error in level argument in plot method has been fixed.

2008-11-03 Datasets 'lepidium' and 'nasturtium' have been added.

2008-10-31: Bug in 'level' argument in plot method has been fixed.

2008-10-02: New function mrdrm() for model-robust modelling included. Accompanying ED and
predict methods also added. 

2008-09-30: The lettuce dataset got correct row numbers.
